```

### Files

- `core.py`: Contains the core functionalities of the chatbot.
- `ingestion.py`: Handles data ingestion and preprocessing.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application, orchestrating the overall workflow.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the `multi-index-chatbot`, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd multi-index-chatbot
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On Windows:

        ```sh
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the chatbot application, execute the `main.py` script:

```sh
python main.py
```

This will start the chatbot, and you can interact with it as per the implemented functionalities.

## Module Descriptions

### main.py

The `main.py` file is the entry point of the application. It initializes and orchestrates the chatbot workflow. The main responsibilities of this module include:

- Setting up the environment and configurations.
- Initializing core components.
- Handling user inputs and outputs.

### core.py

The `core.py` file contains the core functionalities of the chatbot. This includes:

- Defining the chatbot's response logic.
- Managing the state and context of conversations.
- Integrating with external services if necessary.

### ingestion.py

The `ingestion.py` file is responsible for data ingestion and preprocessing. Its main functions are:

- Loading and cleaning the data used by the chatbot.
- Structuring data into multi-index formats for efficient access and querying.
- Providing utility functions to support data handling tasks.
